## 🏏 IPL Data Analysis (2008–2025) – Power BI Project

This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard analyzing 18 seasons of the Indian Premier League (IPL), from 2008 to 2025.
The goal is to transform raw IPL data into meaningful insights through interactive visualizations, performance metrics, and storytelling with data.

#### 📌 Project Overview
The IPL is one of the biggest cricket leagues in the world, generating massive amounts of data every year.
This project focuses on team performance, player achievements, and season-wise comparisons using Power BI.

By leveraging Power Query, DAX, and data modeling, I built an interactive dashboard that answers questions like:
- Who were the season winners and runner-ups?
- Which players had the most sixes, fours, or fifties?
- Who won the Orange Cap & Purple Cap each season?
- How did teams perform across different years?
- What do the points table dynamics look like?
